# Togami Lua Scripts


This project contains various Lua scripts i've made lately for emulation based researching and RNG.

## Gen1RNGResearch.lua
I made Gen1RNGResearch.lua script to help me with gen 1 RNG research.

When the DVs of the enemy pokemon change, the script will output both random numbers generated on that frame, the DVs, and the entropy modifier.

So far I know the rand 1 = DVs 1, but the rest is still up in the air.

Relevant addresses:

* 0x0000CFF1 and 0x0000CFF2 hold the DVs for the first enemy pokemon you are battling in the following order: attack, defense, speed, special. (To calculate HP DV, grab the last bit of each of the other four, and you will have the result)
* 0x0000FFD3 and 0x0000FFD4 have the two pseudorandom numbers generated by the game. They are affected by button presses.
* 0x0000FFFB holds entropy data on button presses. 

The following is a sample list of hex values for button presses. This does not include combined presses, such as select + start.

* A: 01
* B: 02
* Select: 04
* Start: 08
* Right: 10
* Left: 20
* Up: 40
* Down: 80

datasample.csv holds the data on 100 wild pokemon. This script will trigger upon the start of trainer battles as well.

## Roamer Checker.lua
This script displays the hex values for their current location, and for the three roamers in the American versions of Gold and Silver. Support for other versions is easily implemented by changing the addresses.
