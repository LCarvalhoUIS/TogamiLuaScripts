I made this script to help with gen 1 RNG research.
When the DVs of the enemy 1 pokemon change, the script will output both random numbers generated on that frame, the DVs, and the entropy modifier.
So far we know the rand 1 = DVs 1, but the rest is still up in the air
Relevant addresses:
0x0000CFF1 and 0x0000CFF2 hold the DVs for the first enemy pokemon you are battling in the following order: attack, defense, speed, special. (To calculate HP DV, grab the last bit of each of the other four, and you will have the reuslt)
0x0000FFD3 and 0x0000FFD4 have the two pseudorandom numbers generated by the game. They are affected by button presses.
0x0000FFFB holds entropy data on button presses. Below is a sample list of hex values for button presses. This does not include combined presses like select + start that give 0C for example.
Left: 20
Right: 10
Up: 40
Down: 80
A: 01
B: 02
Start: 08
Select: 04
datasample.csv holds the data on 100 wild pokemon. This script will trigger upon the start of trainer battles as wel.
